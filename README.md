This is a replication of De Bondt and Thaler's famous paper "Does the Stock Market Overreact?" in 1985. Our aim is to replicate the result and generalize it to the recent data.

Abstract:
This study investigates whether the stock market overreacts to unexpected and dramatic news events, as suggested by behavioral biases documented in experimental psychology. Using CRSP monthly return data, the analysis finds evidence consistent with the overreaction hypothesis, revealing significant market inefficiencies. Portfolios of prior ``losers" significantly outperform prior ``winners", with losing stocks earning much more than winners over multiple time periods. These results not only explain the phenomenon of overreaction, but also suggest its predictive power for future returns. The findings violate weak-form market efficiency and highlight the role of behavioral principles in asset price movements. The study also examines the seasonality of returns, particularly the January effect, where loser portfolios exhibit persistently large positive excess returns. Based on this, we further validate this perspective using recent data, reaffirming the robustness of these findings in modern market contexts.
